# StudentManagementSystem
This project is a Java-based Student Management System with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing, and data stored in MySQL. It allows users to manage student records through an intuitive interface. The system supports CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — and displays student data in a clean, scrollable view.
